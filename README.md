## API access
API base URLs are: 

>Test environment: `https://warehouse-api-test.azurewebsites.net/api`

>Production environment: `https://warehouse-api.azurewebsites.net/api`

The endpoint is protected by the **authentication token**. The personalizes token is provided to each client via 
`x-client-id` HTTP header. Production and test environments has different tokens and hash keys. 

Also a login and password for the test and production environment required. They are different for test and production environments.

Virtual products for test requests must be "Demo Product-1" and "Demo Product-2". Also it is important to indicate in the request the country of delivery "ES" or "IT". 


### Message signing
 For the message signing the HMAC-SHA1 is used
- Hash key (e.g. HMAC secret) will be provided personally
- A **signature** should be indicated in the `x-signature` HTTP header

## Creating a new outbound request
To create a new request (order) you need following details:

>`POST /outbounds`

**Headers:**

```text
accept: application/json
content-type: application/json
x-client-id: <a guid, provided specially for you>
x-signature: <a HMAC signature you get using `HMAC secret`, provided specially for you>
```
**Body**:

```js 
{  
    "orderNumber":"5", //Each order id should be unique
    "product":
    {  
	    "name":"Product Name",
	    "quantity":2,
	    "price":0.0,
	    "unitPriceForInvoice": "54.90"
    },
    "additionalProducts":
    [
        {
		"name":"Product Name-2",
		"quantity":2,
		"price":0.0, 
		"UnitPriceForInvoice":27.72
        },
	{
		"name":"296041002",
		"quantity":1,
		"price":0.0, 
		"UnitPriceForInvoice":33.12
	}
    ],
    "cashOnDelivery":85.00,
    "receiver":
    {  
	    "firstName":"receiver name",
	    "lastName":"receiver surname",
	    "phoneNumber":"123456789",
	    "emailAddress":"test@test.com",
	    "nationalID":"XXXXXXXXXX",
	    "houseNumber":"122",
	    "addressText":"Some street",
	    "addressAdditionalInfo":"apt. 35",
	    "city":"Venice",
	    "country":"IT",
	    "zipCode":"30123"
    },
    "comment":"some text",
    "whCode":"ITWH6",
    "whCodeAsMandatory":"true",
    "courierService": "SDA",
    "ReasonForExport":"sale",
    "DiscountFlatAmount":0.00,
    "ShippingFlatAmount":0.00,
    "TaxFlatAmount":3.98,
    "CurrencyForInvoice":"EUR",
    "checkBeforeCOD":true,
    "attachments":[
	{
	"documentName" : "name of a file",
	"documentBody" : "base64 string of byte array (binary object of file)",
	"documentType" : "Invoice"
	}
	]
}
```
 **Important!**

- For prepaid orders fill following fields `product.price`, `cashOnDelivery` and `additionalProducts.price` with `0` 
- All fields are required, except `additionalProducts`, `receiver.lastName`, `receiver.emailAddress`, `receiver.houseNumber`, `receiver.nationalID`, `whCode`, `whCodeAsMandatory`, `courierService`,`ReasonForExport`, `DiscountFlatAmount`, `ShippingFlatAmount`, `TaxFlatAmount`, `CurrencyForInvoice`, `checkBeforeCOD`.
- `cashOnDelivery` field is added later with purpose to override calculations of COD, based on `price` field of products. That is, when COD amount is specified in `cashOnDelivery` field and **is greater then zero**, amounts in `price` are ignored.   
- `additionalProducts` field is optional. When you need to send more than one product, first product you need to pass via `product` node and other products in `additionalProducts` array.
- `nationalID` field is used to be included in invoices, which are required in some cases (e.g. sending orders to Spanish islands).
- `whCode` field is optional. If this parameter is passed, then the system will try to send the order to this warehouse. But if there are no leftovers, then to the one where there is.
- `whCodeAsMandatory` field is connected with `whCode` field. This parameter must be set to true if the order should be sent only from the warehouse specified in the `whCode` parameter. If `whCodeAsMandatory` = False, then the system will try to send an order from another warehouse if there is no item in the warehouse specified in `whCode`.
- `courierService` field should be specified only in special cases (should be discussed with WAPI IT team)
- `checkBeforeCOD` field is optional and should be passed only for orders to Bulgaria. This parameter is passed when the package needs to be opened before the client will pay for it.
- `attachments` field can take the following values: CustomsInvoice - invoice to the customs zone; DeliveryNote - just a document describing what is contained in the order or and some additional instructions, for example, such as instructions for returning; Invoice - invoice for the buyer

**Response:**
 
**200 OK** 

Status means that order has been created. In response you are getting the Tracking number of the order registered in WAPI system

```json
{
    "trackingNumber":"WH0000000024"
}
```

_Any status except 200 OK should be considered as an error:_

**401 Unauthorized** 

 `x-client-id` is missing or is wrong

**400 Bad Request**  

Signature or request data is not valid

**500 Internal Server Error** 

 For internal errors
```
{
    "Error": "<SOME ERROR DESCRIPTION>"
}
```
## Preferred delivery date and time parameters
In the Create Order request now can be indicated the preferred Delivery Date and Time in the following format:
 

```js
{
   ...
   "preferredDeliveryDate":"YYYY-MM-DD",
   "preferredDeliveryDayPart":"morning" | "evening"
   ...
}
```
 **Important!**

- Both fields are optional. If the date is indicated in incorrect format, or if the `preferredDeliveryDayPart` will have any other value than `morning` or `evening` these values will be ignored. 

- If in order there is `preferredDeliveryDate` indicated then the order will be sent to the partner not less than 2 days before that date, so that delivery does not happen before the correct date.


## Order to Inpost packomat

To indicate that the order should arrive at a specific packomat, the fields in the request should be specified as follows:
```
{
...
"isSelfCollect": true,
"selfCollectPointName": "Packomat code must be specified here"
...
"receiver":
    { 
           ...
          "addressText":"Packomat address must be specified here",
           ...
    }
...
}
```

 ##  Tracking orders
 
To track the order you should know the tracking (WH) number of the order and should send the below mentioned API request:

```js
{  
    "trackingNumbers":[  
        "WH0000000024",
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Response:**

 **Important!**

- Please note, that you should sign up request as you send it. That is, that payloads `{"TrackingNumbers":["12346126348721"]}` and `{"trackingNumbers": [ "12346126348721" ]}` will have different hash signatures.
The same belongs to line endings and tab spaces in a payload.

The trouble status is tied to a specific status in the status history. This should make it possible to see both the status change or its repetition, and to calculate the delivery attempt.

	"action": "", //Possible Values: 1|3|4|5. Meanings: 1 - ReturnTheSameAddress, 3 - BackToTheSender, 4 - StationaryStorage, 5 - ReturnToOtherAddress
	"newAddress": "",
}
```

GLS IT courier:
```js
{
	"trackingNumber": "",
	"commentForCourier": "",

	"solveCode": "", //Possible Values 1|2|3|7. Meanings: 1 - RedeliveryToTheSameAddress, 2- RedeliveryToOtherAddress, 3 - ReturnToSender, 7 - CustomerPickUp

	"redeliveryDate": "", //YYYY-MM-DD, required if solveCode = 1
	"redeliveryHourFrom": "", //HH:MM, required if solveCode = 1
	"redeliveryHourTo": "", //HH:MM, required if solveCode = 1

	"newAddress": "", // required if solveCode = 2
	"destPostalCode": "", // required if solveCode = 2
	"destCity": "", // required if solveCode =  2
	"destAreaCode": "", // required if solveCode = 2
	"destPhone": "", // required if solveCode = 2
}

Other courier:
```js
{
	"trackingNumber": "",
	"commentForCourier": "",

```


## Cancel an order
To cancel the order you should send the request to the:

> `POST /outbounds/cancelOrder`

You can only cancel an order if it is in the "Pending" status. The order is sent to the warehouse system 1 time in half an hour (at :00 and at :30). At this moment, the order status changes from "Pending" to "Assigned to partner". So, you need to keep in mind that there may not be enough time to cancel the order. Therefore, in situations where you know that a test order will need to be canceled, it is better to send it at time intervals far from :00 and :30.

**Headers:**
```text
accept: application/json
content-type: application/json
x-client-id: <a guid, provided specially for you>
x-signature: <a HMAC signature you get using `HMAC secret`, provided specially for you>
```
**Body:**
```js
{  
    "trackingNumber":"WH0000XXXXXX",  // Enter here the tracking number of the order you want to cancel
    "comment":"test order"
}
```
